21,ETLS 699,01,Discrete Ctrl of Power Elect,"Course Description
Power Electronics (PE) systems (PES) efficiently transform input electrical power in one form to an electrical output in another form; e.g. DC in, AC out. A complete PES is comprised of several subsystems. For example, a PES typically includes the PE conversion electronics, the controls subsystem, the PCB which effectively integrates all PES subsystems, and finally, the thermal management and safety/fault protection subsystem. The common PE topologies associated with the input-output transformation of electrical power are covered in ETLS-746 Power Electronics.
This course is a follow-on to ETLS-746 Power Electronics as an exciting transformation is currently underway with regard to how PES are controlled. Traditionally, PES were controlled using classical analog methods. Over the past decade, state-of-art DSPs, FPGAs, and microcontrollers have become sufficiently capable to enable the discrete control of modern PES. In this PE controls class the foundations of state-space methods of discrete control of PES will be introduced and covered along with particular attention given to model predictive control (MPC) methods as applicable to PES.
Prerequisites: (1) Undergraduate controls (ENGR-410) and ETLS-746 Power Electronics (or their respective equivalents) or (2) Instructor permission. Prior completion of ETLS-810 Advanced Control Systems will enhance the course experience. A working knowledge of PSIM and Matlab is required."
